# Bevy Stealth Sound Game

My attempt to mimic the game mechanics of "SONAR" in the Bevy engine. It's gonna be mostly pseudo-code for a while, so be patient.

## ToDo

- [x] Load entities from YAML files rather than hard-coding them.
- [ ] Spawning entities from config files.
- [ ] Animated mesh entity.
- [ ] Use Bevy animation demo fox model to test complex animating entities.
- [ ] Make custom gltf level and load everything with scene-hooks.
- [ ] Automatic animation based on movement.
- [ ] Smooth blended transitions between animations.
- [ ] Player input movement.
- [ ] Use smooth-bevy-cameras to make camera follow the player.
- [ ] Use vleue_navigator for nav-mesh pathing.
- [ ] Waypoint patrolling.
- [ ] bevy_rapier integration?
- [ ] Multiple level loading.
- [ ] Pickup implementation.
- [ ] Weapons implementation.
- [ ] Enemy vision.
- [ ] Dialog bubble effects.
- [ ] Sound wave physics and logic.
- [ ] Basic UI.
- [ ] Implement localization support and migrate all user-facing strings.
- [ ] Menu animations.
