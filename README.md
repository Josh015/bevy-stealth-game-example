# Bevy Stealth Sound Game

My attempt to mimic the game mechanics of "SONAR" in the Bevy engine. This is gonna be very pseudo-codey for a while, so be patient.

## TODO

- [ ] Load entities and actions from YAML files rather than hard-coding them.
- [ ] Multiple level loading.
- [ ] Use glb nav-mesh from vleue_navigator for test level.
- [ ] Use Cake Addict and Fox models from Bevy demos to test entities and animations.
- [ ] Make custom glb level and load everything with scene-hooks.
- [ ] Implement localization support for all user-facing strings.
